AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) for IEEE 14-bus System

This repository contains Python code for performing AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) analysis on the IEEE 14-bus system using the pypower library.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
numpy
matplotlib
pypower

The provided code allows you to perform AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) analysis on the IEEE 14-bus system. By modifying the relevant parameters, such as branch limits, bus voltage limits, generator power limits, and generator cost coefficients, you can analyze the system under different conditions and optimize the power flow.

Please note that the code assumes successful convergence of the AC OPF. If the convergence fails, appropriate error handling should be implemented to handle such cases.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your specific requirements.
